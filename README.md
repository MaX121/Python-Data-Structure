This is a collection of my source code that handle the data structure for Python.
Currently, I'm working on Dictionary, List, Tuple, and other thing like LinkedList, Hashmap, Heap, and other kind of data structure
I'm not an expert programmer. This is just a "game" when I bored doing something as you can read on the repository description.
